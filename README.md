## üõ†Ô∏è **Function Declarations**
TypeScript supports precise type annotations in function declarations.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

## Variables can be declared using let, const, or var, with strict typing.

```typescript

let name: string = "John";
const age: number = 30;
var isDeveloper: boolean = true;

```

Key Points:

Use let and const for block scoping.
Explicit types or type inference ensure type safety.

## Tuples

```typescript
let user: [string, number] = ["John", 30];
```

Key Points:

Ensures type safety for indexed values.
Suitable for structured data.
